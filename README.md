# Boston House Prediction

 Project Overview:
----------------

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate housing prices in Boston using the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Boston Housing Dataset, which contains various features related to housing attributes such as crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, and nitric oxide concentration.

Requirements:
----------------------

To run and deploy the project using Streamlit, follow the steps below:

1.  Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

    -   Python (version 3.6 or later)
    -   NumPy
    -   Pandas
    -   Scikit-learn
    -   Streamlit

    You can install the necessary Python packages using pip, the package installer for Python. Open a terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

    `pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn streamlit`

4.  Make sure you have the Boston Housing Dataset available. You can download it from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/boston-house-prices

5.  Open the Python script (e.g., `app.py`) in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE).

6.  Modify the script to provide the correct path to the Boston Housing Dataset file.

7.  Save the modified script.

Deployment with Streamlit:
-------------------------

To deploy the project using Streamlit, follow the steps below:

1.  In the terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory.

2.  Run the following command to start the Streamlit application:

    `streamlit run app.py`

3. Use the provided input fields and buttons to interact with the application and make predictions for housing prices.
